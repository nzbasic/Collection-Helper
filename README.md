<table>
<tr>
<td>

Collection Helper is a tool you can use to manage your collections in osu!. It aims to make editing  and sharing your collections quick and easy with its intuitive interface. Included is a very powerful custom filter interface which allows you to programatically filter through your beatmaps by writing your own code. 

The key features of **Collection Helper**:

- Available in English and Russian (thanks Maks220v for Russian translation)
- Add/remove/merge collections
- Edit collections
- Apply ingame filters to select maps
- Import and Export collections (WIP)
- Ability to create custom filters using javascript
- Inbuilt stream and farm filters
- Backup your collections
- Automatically generate practice difficulties with configurable length

### Built With

- [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular)
- [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron)
- [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)

### Demo

Example making a collection with the farm filter. Note: you only have to generate cache for a filter once.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

[osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh)

You must have run your osu! client at least once.

### Usage

#### Building yourself (for devs)

Please follow these steps to build the project yourself:

1. Pull the repo
2. Install dependencies in both frontend and backend (/ and /app/)
3. Run "npm run electron:build" (or "npm run start" to dev)
4. Run the installer found in /releases/

#### Custom filters

<a href="https://youtu.be/ukOA1JCHLLo">Video Guide</a>

Custom filters work by passing you a list of beatmaps which get filtered by your code.

Any function you write must resolve with a list of beatmaps. Minimum boilerplate code is given when creating a new custom filter.

Your filter will be passed 4 objects: The resolve function, a list of beatmaps, axios for any request needs, and farmSets which is a list of osutracker.com farm sets.

If you want to use a beatmaps hit objects, you must select the Get HitObjects checkbox on the creation screen. Note: this will cause the filter to take a lot longer to cache, on my computer this is about 15 minutes for 87000 maps.

To use any custom filter in the collection edit screen, you must generate its cache first in the filters screen. This ensures the filters can be applied instantly to a list of maps instead of having to process every beatmap every time.
